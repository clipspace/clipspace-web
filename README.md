# clipspace 🖇️

**Your space. Your people. Your keys.**

Clipspace is a free, open-source, end-to-end encrypted social network that
belongs to the people on it. No ads, no tracking, no big tech — held together
by a paperclip, not a corporation.

This repository holds the **showcase website**, live at
[clipspace.djt-group.com](https://clipspace.djt-group.com). The network
itself is a work in progress — star the repo to follow the build.

## What clipspace stands for

- **End-to-end encrypted** — everything is encrypted on your device; your keys never leave your pocket
- **100% open source** — clients, server, crypto; read the code, or find someone who did
- **Free forever** — privacy is the default, not a subscription
- **Spaces, not feeds** — small circles of real people instead of an algorithmic firehose
- **Self-hostable** — your data lives where you say
- **No phone number** — who you are on clipspace is up to you

## The site

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.
Featuring a one-legged paperclip pal who walks along as you scroll and
keeps you company. He means well — and he is a package of his own:
[`clip-pal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clip-pal)
([source](https://github.com/clipspace/clip-pal)), so you can put him on
your site too.

The homepage also has a feedback form. It needs `RESEND_API_KEY` (see
`.env.example`); without it the form tells visitors to email instead.

### Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
